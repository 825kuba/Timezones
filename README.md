# TIMEZONES

Vanilla JS app that let's the user look up current time in different timezones.
User's can add the timezones to their "favourites" list, called "My places".

It uses local storage and https://timezonedb.com/ API.

It's not completely finished, i.e. only 2 places can be added to "My places", error message system isn't great either, and some other stuff. I plan on rebuilding it with React in the future.
