# TIMEZONES

Vanilla JS app that let's the user look up current time in different timezones.
User's can add the timezones to their "favourites" list, called "My places".

It uses https://timezonedb.com/ API free plan, and thus only supports one call per second (actually I could get away with 2).
So for now there is a limit of 2 places that can be added.
